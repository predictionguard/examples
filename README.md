# Generative AI Engineering - Composable Building Blocks, Example Applications, and Guides

This repo includes the materials for GenAI workshops. The materials were prepared by Daniel Whitenack for live attendees. However, others might benefit from them as they build generative AI applications.

## GenAI Building Blocks Workshop

1. [example1](genai-building-blocks/example1) - Basic LLM Chatbot
2. [example2](genai-building-blocks/example2) - Naive RAG
3. [example3](genai-building-blocks/example3) - LLM testing
4. [example4](genai-building-blocks/example4) - Advanced RAG
5. [example5](genai-building-blocks/example5) - Text-to-SQL/ Tool calling
6. [example6](genai-building-blocks/example6) - Safeguarding LLM Applications
