        "**As you solve problems with LLMs, do NOT always think about your task as a single prompt.** Decompose your problem into multiple steps. Just like programming which uses multiple functions, classes, etc. LLM integration is a new kind of reasoning engine that you can \"program\" in a multi-step, conditional, control flow sort of fashion.\n",

To deal with this we need to **ground** on LLM operations with external data."

Instead of relying solely on the knowledge contained within the model's parameters, RAG allows the model to dynamically retrieve and integrate information from an external database or a set of documents during the generation process. By doing so, it provides a bridge between the vast knowledge stored in external sources and the powerful generation abilities of neural models, enabling more informed, diverse, and context-aware outputs in tasks like question answering, dialogue systems, and more."
